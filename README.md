### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a developer based in the US, a lot of my open source work is related to web development stuff, but I do some other random projects as well. My largest project is [OpenCircuits](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/) which is a free, online, digital circuit designer.

My website is http://leonmontealeg.re/


## What I'm up to

Currently, I'm doing a lot of small side-projects related to physics simulation, along with readily working on [OpenCircuits](https://github.com/OpenCircuits/).  
You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KingDolphinGuy), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/LeonMontealegre) or whatever else you can find me on probably.
